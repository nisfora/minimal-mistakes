Currently, an AI Robotics researcher at
<a href="http://www.nhkinternational.com/" target="_blank">NHK International Corporation, USA</a>,
leading the development of Robotics based SOTA reinforcement algorithms.
Previously, a Cooperative Autonomous Vehicle Researcher at
<a href="http://www.eecs.ucf.edu/NSL/" target="_blank">Networked Systems Lab, UCF</a>.
Here I worked on cutting-edge technologies in the field of Connected Autonomous Vehicles.
Our main focus of research at NSL had been the development of Safety Applications and
Advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) for automated vehicles. My specialties also
include tackling challenges in Sensor Fusion, Path Planning, and Localization by developing
highly robust algorithms & accurate deep learning models.
<br>In my leisure time, I love to do gardening, play chess, read books/blogs and travel. If you share a
similar
motivation and interests, <br><b>let's connect!</b>
